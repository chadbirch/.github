## Work

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at @Lexmark. Unfortuantley, due to the nature of the work we do, all of my code I write at work is close-source. I dabble in a few side projects, which I have displayed below. 

## Volunteer

I volunteer my time with a number of organizations in and around my hometown. Those include:

* [Stanton City Park](https://www.stantonky.gov/parks)
* [Hollerwood Park](https://hollerwoodpark.com/)
* [Powell County Broadband Comission](https://www.facebook.com/PoCoBroadband/)
* Powell County Tourism - Turkey Knob Property Development Project

## Recreation

I spend my free time (which is in short supply) drumming. My current band, [The Perfect Strangers](https://theperfectstrangers.band/), plays throughtout the Eastern and Central Kentucky regions. This occupies a decent amount of time on the weekends.

## Projects

The two projects I'm actively involved with are realted to the Stanton City Park and my badn, The Perfect Strangers. 

* [Stanton City Park](https://github.com/CityOfStanton) | [Kiosk Client](https://github.com/CityOfStanton/Kiosk-Client) - A simple Windows Store app that we use to display remotely updatable information on low-cost TV screens throughtout the park.
* [The Perfect Strangers](https://github.com/ThePerfectStrangers/) | [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/ThePerfectStrangers/TechnicalDocumentation) - A repo used to maintain the technical documentation for the band. The interesting part is the automation using GitHub Actions to handle document conversion and repository updates.
